### About
Csion aims to optimize people’s decisions about any subject based on 
their characteristic behaviours within a short amount of time.
We are using Myers-Briggs Personality types to have an initial categorization of the users' characters. This test is highly standardized and is esteemed in the field of psychology. There are 16 unique personalities and each person can find their personality type by solving simple and quick test question. These types have certain borderline character traits that generally conform to the way people behave. Although it is a deciding factor, personality alone is not the only variable when a person makes a decision. The other circumstantial factors such as users' preferences and current mood will also be constantly updated via random questions throughout the day, to be able to give a more personalized result. We will try to identify the problem at hand by asking several questions to the user. According to the given choices, the app will ask the users to indicate the pros and cons of that problem and give a rating for each pro/con where users will also indicate their current mood. Each answer will be labelled as a variable and the result of the pros and cons section will be analysed. After collecting every necessary input, the algorithm will compare the labelled variables with personality variables and it will create an output. The output will be a detailed analysis of the decision at hand, with sections such as emotional and rational aspects of the problem and coherence between the user’s personality traits and the problem itself. The output will show the percentages of people who have the same type of personality who inquired a similar problem as well as whether or not they were happy with the outcome of the decision. This information will be gathered from users by collecting feedback after a certain amount of time has passed since their decision. Finally, the output will indicate a reasonable decision for users.
